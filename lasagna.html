        <p1>Lasagna is a classic Italian comfort food made of layers of tender pasta sheets, savory meat sauce, creamy ricotta or béchamel, and melted mozzarella, all baked to perfection. The dish starts with a rich meat sauce made from ground beef or pork, simmered with garlic, onions, and tomatoes, then layered with pasta and a cheesy filling. As the layers build, the combination of flavors melds together, creating a satisfying and hearty meal. Once baked until bubbly and golden, lasagna is allowed to rest before serving, allowing the flavors to set. It’s a crowd-pleasing dish perfect for family dinners or special occasions.</p1>

            <li>Onion and garlic: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
            <li>Tomato products: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
            <li>Sugar: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Noodles: Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li>Cheese: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
            <li>Egg: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</li>
