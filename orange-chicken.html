        <p1>Orange chicken is a popular Chinese-American dish featuring crispy, golden-brown chicken pieces tossed in a tangy, sweet orange sauce. To make it, bite-sized pieces of chicken are coated in a seasoned batter and deep-fried until crispy. Meanwhile, a sauce is prepared by simmering orange juice, zest, soy sauce, sugar, vinegar, garlic, ginger, and a touch of cornstarch to thicken it. Once the chicken is fried, it's tossed in the sauce until each piece is coated, creating a delicious balance of sweet, sour, and savory flavors. The dish is often garnished with green onions and served over steamed rice, making it a satisfying and flavorful meal.</p1>
