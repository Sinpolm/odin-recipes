        <p1>Pancakes are a classic breakfast favorite, known for their light, fluffy texture and slightly sweet flavor. To make them, combine flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, milk, eggs, and melted butter into a smooth batter. Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle and ladle the batter onto it, cooking until bubbles form on the surface before flipping to brown the other side. Once cooked, stack the pancakes high and serve with your choice of syrup, butter, fresh fruit, or whipped cream for a delicious and comforting meal. Perfect for a lazy morning or a weekend brunch, pancakes are versatile and can be customized with toppings and mix-ins like chocolate chips or nuts.</p1>
